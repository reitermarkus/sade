There isn't really any decent way (at least one that I know of) to judge the quality of an elective course in advance outside of word of mouth from students who visited it in a previous semester.
I would personally recommend this one, though. ","6-7 hours","Yes","","The topic we chose worked out well and delivered deep enough data for us to make some meaningful statements based on it. Working on the project also demonstrated that you need to properly understand your data-set to not end up producing nonsensical results.

It was also entertaining to see how easy it is to change the outcome of your analysis simply by changing a couple of variables in your definitions and search terms - I'm sure there is some overused quote about statistics regarding this phenomena. ","There were a lot of things on the Homework sheets (as well as the .ipynb files from the lecture itself) offered many examples in how to properly represent and work with your data - e.g. stuff like the different Graphs, setting up a prediction model, accessing and loading files.
